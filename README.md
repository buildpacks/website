# Buildpacks.io

The website for [buildpacks.io](https://buildpacks.io).

## Getting started

As the site is static HTML and CSS, there is no need to run any build steps or processes. That said, to simplify development, you can run the app with Browsersync for a local server and live reloading.

```
yarn
yarn start
```
